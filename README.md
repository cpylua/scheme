Another Dirty Scheme Interpreter
================================

> *"We were actually trying to build something complicated and 
discovered, serendipitously, that we had accidentally designed 
something that met all our goals but was much simpler than we
had intended....we realized that the lambda calculus--a small,
simple formalism--could serve as the core of a powerful and 
expressive programming language." -- Sussman and Steele*

Writing a Scheme interpreter is easy, and more importantly,
it is fun.


Features included:
-----------------
+ lambda, of course
+ integer(32 bit), floating-point numbers, string, symbol, boolean,
character, pair
+ basic mathematical functions
+ basic input/output support
+ cond, if, let, begin, and, or, define, set!, apply, eval...
+ var-arg
+ a small core library
+ mark-sweep garbage collector
+ You should be able to use this Scheme interpreter to run all
codes in *The Little Schemer*.

There is a small todo list, see **TODO.md.**
